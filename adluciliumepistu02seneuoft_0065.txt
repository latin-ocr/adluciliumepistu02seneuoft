d to crave so passionately, must turn away both
es and ears from the objects which he has aban-
ned. The emotions soon return to the attack;
{t every turn they will notice before their eyes an
hbject worth their attention. There is no evil that
not offer inducements. Avarice promises
ffissfissnffss‘ussafasssffi ffissffffssssssu‘ssssff'ssaiu'tefig
nfluence which results from applause, and all that
nfluence can do. Vices tempt you by the rewards
vwhich they offer3 but in the life of which I speak,
rou must live without being paid. Scarcely will a
'thole life-time suffice to bring our vices into subjec-
ἀοι] and to make them accept the yoke‚ swollen as
ey are by long-continued indulgence3 and still
, if we cut into our brief span by any interrup-
ns. Even constant care and attention can scarcely
' g any one undertaking to full completion. If
will give ear to my advice, ponder and practise
*iar-how to welcome death, .or even, if circum-
ωερε commend that course, to invite it. There is
φ difference whether death comes to uS‚ or whether
go to death. Make yourself believe that all
ἔσται men are wrong when they say: “lt is a
utiful thing to die one’s own death.” α But there
fi no man who does not die his own death. What
Β more, you may reflect on this thought: No one
fleu except on his own day. You are throwing away
none of your own time; for what you leave behind
bes not belong to you. Farewell.
