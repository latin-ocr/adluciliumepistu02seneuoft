'sts of all this which seems to exist, except the
’verse alone. α Zeno of Elea removed all the

othing exists. The Pyrrhonean, Megarian, Eretrian,
d Academic schools are all engaged in practically
e same task; they have introduced a new know-
dge, non· ·knowledge. You may sweep all these
eories in with the superfluous troops of‘ ‘liberal”
dies; the one class of men give me a knowledge
at will be of no use to me, the other class do
ay with any hope of attaining knowledge. It is
tter, of course, to know useless things than to
ow nothing. One set of philosophers offers no
ght by which I may direct my gaze toward the
uth; the other digs out my very eyes and leaves
e blind. If I cleave to Protagoras, there' is nothing
the scheme of nature that is not doubtful; if Ι
old with Nausiphanes, Ι am sure only of this—that
verything is unsure; if with Parmenides, there is
¹othing except the One ὃ· , if with Zeno, there is not
ven the One.

What are we, then ? What becomes of all these
ahings that sui-round us, support us, sustain us?
I'he whole universe is then a vain or deceptive
shadow. 1 cannot readily say whether Ι am more
exed at those who would have it that we know
nothing, or with those who would not leave us even
,his privilege. Farewell.
