EPISTLE LXXXI.

ents such as we Stoics are wont to make and such
the Greeks call “ paradoxes,'' ⁰ and will say: “ Do
ou maintain, then, that only the wise man knows
ow to return a favour? Do you maintain that no
ne else knows how to make restoration to a creditor
or a debt? Or, on buying a commodsty, to pay full
alue to the seller?” In order not to bring any
'um upon myself, let me tell you that Epicurus says
the same thing. At any rate, Metrodorus remarks b

of love and of friendship to return favours;

Ὶιι say the same thing! Or do you - think that
fixere is any loyalty in him who does not know how
’· return a favour? These men, accordingly, should

ng the crowd we find only the ghost and the

· to return a favour. Even a fool can return it in
ξ ·portion to his knowledge and his power3 his fault
L·uld be a lack of knowledge rather than a lack of
¹ or desire. To will does not come by teaching.
, The wisc man will compare all things with oue
