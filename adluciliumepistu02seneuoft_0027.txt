EPISTLE LXVI.

he will entrust himself as readily to an honourable
deed as he would to a good man3 he will consider it
advantageous to himself, safe, propitious. And he
will hold the same view concerning an honourable
deed, even though it be fraught with sorrow and
hardship, as concerning a good man who is poor or
wasting away in exile. Come now, contrast a good
man who is rolling in wealth with a man who has
nothing, except that in himself he has all things3
they will be equally good, though they experience

unequal fortune. This same standard, as Ι have Ἆρ’

’ Now friendship in the case of men corresponds to

’ desirability in the case of things. You would not, I
fancy, love a good man if he were rich any more
than if he were poor, nor would you love a strong
and muscular person more than one who was slender
and of delicate constitution. Accordingly, neither
will you seek or love a good thing that is mirthful
and tranquil more than one that is full of perplexity
