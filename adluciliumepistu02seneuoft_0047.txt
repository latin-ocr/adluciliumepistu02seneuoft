e middle of summer. Accordingly, l spend most
f the time bundled up3 and 1 thank old age for
ceping me fastened to my bed.⁰ Why should 1 not
ank old age on this account? That which I ought
ot ιο wish to do, Ι lack the ability to do. Most
of my converse is with books, Whenever your
letters arrive, l imagine that I am with you, and I
have the feeling that 1 am about to speak my answer,
instead of writing it. Therefore let us together
investigate the nature of this problem of yours, just
as if we were conversing with one another.¹’

You ask me whether every good is desirable.
You say: “ If it is a good ιο be brave under torture,
ιο go to the stake with a stout beart, to endure
illness with resignation, it follows that these things
are desirable. But 1 do not see that any of them is
worth praying for. At any rate l have as yet known
bf no man who has paid a vow by reason of having
cut to pieces by the rod, or twisted out of
pe by the gout, or made taller by the rack.'' My
dear Lucilius, you must distinguish between these
casem you will then comprehend that there is
something in them that is to be desired.1 should

conduct myself therein with bravery, honour, and
leont-age. Of course 1 prefer that war should not
occul-3 but if war does occur, 1 shall desire that 1 may
nobly endure the wounds, the starvation, and all that
the exigency of war brings. Nor am 1 so mad as to
crave illness3 but if 1 must suffer illness, 1 shall desire
that l may do nothing which shows lael< of restraint,
md nothing that· ιε unmanly. The conclusion is, not
that hardshgips are desirable, but that virtue is desir-
nble, which enables us patiently ιο endure hardships.
