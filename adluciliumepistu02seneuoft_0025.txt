EPISTLE LXVI.

“ Are you trying to make us believe that it does not
matter whether a man feels joy, or whether he lies
upon the rack and tires out his torturer Ρ ” Ι might
say in answer: “Epicurus also maintains that the
wise man, though he is being burned in the bull
of Phalaris,⁰ will cry out: ‘ 'Tis pleasant, and con-
cerns me not at all! ’' Why need you wonder,
if Ι maintain that he who reclines at a banquet and
the victim who stoutly withstands torture Α possess
equal goods, when Epicurus maintains a thing that
is harder to believe, namely, that it is pleasant to
be roasted in this way? But the reply which I do
make, is that there is great difference between joy
and pain; if Ι am asked to choose, I shall seek
the former and avoid the latter. The former is
according to nature, the latter contrary to it. So
long as they are rated by this standard, there is a

all lights which shine without the help of virtue are κ’

in contact with virtue, play no more important a part 'mm

This can be proved to you by the fact that the
good man will hasten unhesitatingly to any noble
deed; even though he be confronted by the hangman,
the torturer, and the stake, he will persist, regarding
not what he must suffer, but what he must do3 and
