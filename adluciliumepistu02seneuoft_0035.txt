¹ s roSS, and that which is neither good nor evil she
odges as merely accessory‚ insignificant and trivial.
⁸'or all her good resides in the soul.
But there are certain goods which reason regards
primary, to which she addresses herself purposely3
hese are, for example, victory, good children, and
ibe welfare of one's country. Certain others she
egards as secondary; these become manifest only
adversity,—for example, equanimity in enduring
vere illness or exile. Certain goods are indifferent3
ωε are no more according to nature than contrary
nature, as, for example, a discreet gait and a
te posture in a chair. For sitting is an act that
*s not less according to nature than standing or
alking. The two kinds of goods which are of a
higher order are different; the primary are accord-
to nature, —such as deriving joy from the
lutiful behaviour of one’ s children and from the
nell -being of one’ s country ΤΙιε secondary are
traryto nature, —such as fortitude in resisting

thing that ss contrary to nature be a g'ood?’ f

out it is in accordance with nature for a man to pre-
me an indomitabl soul amid such distresses To
&plain my thoughtelwriefly, the material with which
ι good is concerned is sometimes contrary to nature,
