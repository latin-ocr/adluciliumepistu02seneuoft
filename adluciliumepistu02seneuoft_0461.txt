EPISTLE XCII.

‚a spark have in the midst of this clear sunlight?
¹ If you are not contented with only that which is
ι honoumble, it must follow that you desire in addition
beither the kind of quiet which the Greeks call
b “ undisturbedness,” or else pleasure. But the former
may be attained in any case. For the mind is free
from disturbance when it is fully free to contemplate
the universe, and nothing disti-acts it from the con-
templation of nature. The second, pleasure, is simply
the good of cattle. We are but adding ⁶ the irrational
to the rational, the dishonourable to the honourable.
A pleasant physical sensation affects this life of ours ;
why, therefore, do you hesitate to say that all is well
with a man just because all is well with his appetite?
And do you rate, I will not say among heroes, but
among men, the person whose Supreme Good is a
matter of flavours and colours and sounds? Nay,
let him withdraw from the ranks of this, the noblest
lclass of living beings, second only to the gods; let
>him herd with the dumb brutes—an animal whose
delight is in fodder!

The irrational part of the soul is twofold ὗε the
one part is spirited, ambitione, uncontrolled; its seat
‘is m the passion83 the other is lowly, sluggish, and
devoted to pleasure. Philosophers have neglected
the former, which, though unbrfflled, is yet better,
and is certainly more courageous and more worthy
of a man, and have regarded the latter, which
1⁸ nerveless and ignoble, as indispensable to the
happy life. They have ordered reason to serve this
latta-3 they have made the Supreme Good of the
¹{noblest living being an abject and mean affair, and
ι monstrous hybrid, too, composed of various members
