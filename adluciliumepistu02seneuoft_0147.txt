unless he has leaped over the intervemng years,
and has projected himself into the trouble that is
{destined to ari-ive a generation later. In the same
way, souls that enjoy being sick and that seize upon
eexcuses for sorrow are saddened by events long past
=and effaced from the records. Past and future are
both absent3 we feel neither of them. But there
can be no pain except as the result of what you
feel. Farewell.

LXXV. ΟΝ ΤΗΕ DISEASES OF THE SOUL

You have been complaining that my letters to
you are rather carelessly written. Now who talks
carefully unless he also desires to talk affectedlyss?
I prefer that my letters should be just what my
conversation⁶ would be if you and I were sitting in
one another's company or taking walks together,—
spontaneous and easy3 for my letters have nothing
strained or artificial about them. 1f it were possible,
1 should prefer to show, rather than speak, my
feelings. Even if 1 were arguing a point, 1 should
not stamp my foot, or toss my arms about, or raise
my voice; but 1 should leave that sort of thing to the
orator, and should be content to have conveyed my
feelings to you without having either embellished
them or lowen-ed their dignity. 1 should like to
convince you entirely of this one fact,—that Ι feel
whatever 1 say, that Ι not only feel it, but am
wedded to it. 1t is one sort of kiss which a man
gives his mistress, and another which he gives his
children3 yet in the father's embrace also, holy and
restrained as it is, plenty of affection is disclosed.
