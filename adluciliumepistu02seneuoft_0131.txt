'upright men often suffer misfortunes,a and that the
:time which is allotted to us is but short and scanty,
fif ygu compare it with the eternity which is allotted
,to t e universe.

It is a result of complaints like these that we are
funappreciative in our comments upon the gifts of
,heaven; we complain because they are not always
j granted to uS‚ because they are few and unsure and
lfleeting. Hence we have not the will either⁴ to live
lor to die ; we are possessed by hatred of life,
{by sear of death. Our plans are all at sea, and no
{amount of prosperity can satisfy us, And the reason
.for all this is that we have not yet attained to that

=there is no place beyond the highest. Do, you ask
why virtue needs nothing? Because it is pleased
*with what it has, and does not lust after that which
it has not. Whatever is enough is abundant in the
1eyes of virtue.

Dissent from this judgment, and duty and loyalty
will not abide. For one who desires to exhibit these
two qualities must endure much that the world calls
evil; we must sacrifice many things to which we
are addicted‚ thinking them to be ·goods Gone is
eourage, which should be continually testing itself3
gone is greatness of soul, which cannot stand out
clearly unless it has learned to scorn as trivial every-
thing that the crowd covets as supremely important3
and gone is kindness and the repaying of kindness‚
ff we sear toil, if we have acknowledged anything
to be more precious than loyalty, if our eyes are
fixed upon anything except the best.

But to pass these questions by: either these so-
ulled goods are not goodS, or else man is more
