EPISTLE LXX.

LXX. ΟΝ THE PROPER TIME TO SLIP
THE CABLE

      

After a long space of time I have seen your

others are carried quickly home by steady gales.
J, You may consider that the same thing happens to

pidity to the harbour, the harbour they were bound
to reach even if they tarried on the way, while others
‘it bas fretted and harassed. To such a life, as you
