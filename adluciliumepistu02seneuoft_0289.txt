pack close the flowing honey,
And swell their cells with nectar sweet.⁸

It is not certain whether the juice which they obtain
¹ from the flowers forms at once into honey, or whether
they change that which they have gathered into this
delicious object by blending something therewith and
by a certain property of their breath. For some
authorities believe that bees do not possess the art
of making honey, but only of gathering it ; and they
say that in India honey has been found on the leaves
of certain reeds, produced by a dew peculiar to that
climate, or by the juice of the reed itself, which has
ι an unusual sweetness and richnessJ> And in our own
, ses too, they say, the same quality exists,
¹ although less clear and less evident3 and a creature
born to fulfil such a function could hunt it out and
collect it. Certain others maintain that the materials
which the bees have culled from the most delicate of
ἴ blooming and flowering plants· is transformed into
this peculiar substance by a process of preserving and
ι careful storing away, aided by what might be called
fermentation,—whereby separate elements are united
ι into one substance.

But 1 must not be led astray into another subJect
; than that which we are discussing. We also, I say,
ought to copy these bees, and sifi: whatever we have
, gathered from a varied course of reading, for such
. things are better preserved if they are kept separate3
then, by applying the supervising care with which our
, nature has endowed us,—in other words, our natural
ι gist8,—we should so blend those several flavours into
¹ one delicious compound that, even though it betrays
¹ its origin, yet it nevertheless is clearly a different
thing from that whence it came. This is what we see
ι nature doing in our own bodies without any labour
