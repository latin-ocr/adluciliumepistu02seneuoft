But Posidonius again remarks: “ Democritus is
said to have discovered the arch‚⁰ whose effect was
that the curving line of stones, which gradually lean
toward each other, is bound together by the key-
stone.” 1 am inclined to pronounce this statement
false. For there must have been, before Democritus,
bridges and gateways in which the curvature did not
begin until about the top. It seems, to have quite

which we see done just as well, or even more skil-

followed as the other animals do, with eyes too dull
to perceive the divine in it. ln the second place,
there is the law of life, and life he has made to
conform to universal principles; and he has taught

to give heed to false opinions, and has weighed the
value of each thing by a true standard of appraise-
ment. He has condemned those pleasures with
which remorae is intermingled, and has praised those
goods which will always satisfy3 and he has published
the truth abroad that he is most happy who has no
