which is fitting, and nothing more level than that
which is level. You cannot say that one thing is
nore equal to a given object than another thing3
oence also nothing is more honourable than that which
s honourable. Accordingly, if all the virtues are by
nature equal, the three varieties⁰ of goods are equal.
this is what 1 mean: there is an equality between
feeling joy with sels-control and suffering pain with
sels-control. The joy in the one case does not sur·
nass in the other the steadfastness of soul that gulps
down the groan when the victim is in the clutches

'hile those of the second are worthy of admiration3
in each case they are none the less equal,
whatever inconvenience attaches to the latter
ιι compensated by the qualities of the good, which is so
uch greater. Any man who believes them to be un-
ual is turning his gaze away from the virtues them-
ves and is surve ing mere externals3 true goods
