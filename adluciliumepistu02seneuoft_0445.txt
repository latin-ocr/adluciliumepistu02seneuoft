EPISTLE xc1.

War arises in the midst of peace, and that which we
depended upon for protection is transformed into a
cause of fear ; friend becomes enemy, ally becomes
foeman. The summer calm is stirred into sudden
stormS, wilder than the storms of winter! With
no foe in sight we are victims of such fates as foes

feebleness of our selves and our works, if all things
should perish as slowly as they come into being; but

agencies stir up commotion, yet evils burst forth
from sources whence they were least expected.

breign wars crash to the ground though no one sets
them tottering. How few the states which have
carried their good fortune through to the end!

We should therefore reflect upon all contingencies,
