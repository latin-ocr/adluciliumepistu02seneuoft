EPISTLE LXXII.

    
  

J Lxxn. ON BUSINESS As THE ENEMY
Ι OF PHILOSOPHY

The subject⁰ concerning which you question me
as once clear to my mind, and required no thought,
so thoroughly had Ι mastered it, But 1 have not
{tested my memory of it for some time, and therefore
sit does not readily come back to me. I feel that 1
«have suffered the fate of a book whose rolls have
ystuck together by disuse; my mind needs to be
unrolled, and whatever has been stored away there
ought to be examined from time to time, so that
tit may be ready for use when occasion demands.
Let us therefore put this subject off for the present3
for it demands much labour and much care. As
soon as l can hope to stay for any length of time
in the same place, 1 shall then take your question in
hand. For there are certain subjects about which
you can write even while travelling in a gig, and
there are also subjects which need a study- chair,
and quiet, and seclusion. Nevertheless I ought to
accomplish something even on days like these,—
days which are fully employed, and indeed from
morning till night. For there is never a moment
when fresh employments will not come along; we
σον them, and for this reason several spring up
from one. Then, too, we keep adjourning our own
enses? saying: “As soon as 1 am done with this‚I
shall settle down to hard work,’' or: “ If I ever set
this troublesome matter in order, Ι shall devote
myself to study.''
But the study of philosophy is not to be postponed
until you have leisure;⁶ everything else is to be
neglected in order that we may attend to philosophy,
