Ehe may retire to nobler affairs,⁰ cherishes those who
*have made it possible for him to do this in security3
§he is the only person who returns spontaneous thanks
lto them, the only person who owes them a great debt
without their knowledge. Just as a man honours
and reveres his teachers, by whose aid he has found
release from his early wanderings, so the sage honours
these men, also, under whose guardianship he can
put his good theories into practice. But you answer:
,“ Other men too are protected by a king’s personal
power.” Perfectly true. But just as, out of a
number of persons who have profited by the same
stretch of calm weather, a man deems that his debt
to Neptune is greater if his cargo during that voyage
has been more extensive and valuable, and just as
the vow is paid with more of a will by the merchant
than by the passenger, and just as, from among the
merchants themselves, heartier thanks are uttered by
&the dealer in spices‚ purple fabrics, and objects worth
itheir weight in gold, than by him who has gathered
'‘eheap merchandise that will be nothing but ballast
13 for his ship; similarly, the benefits of this peace,
flwhich extends to all, are more deeply appreciated
:j by those who make good use of it.

For there are many of our toga-clad citizens to
jwhom peace brings more trouble than war. Or do
fthose‚ think you, owe as much as we do for the peace
&they enjoy, who spend it in drunkenness, or in lust,
‘jor in other vices which it were worth even a war to
,1 interrupt? No, not unless you think that the wise
‘man is so unfair as to believe that as an individual
fige owes nothing in return sor the advantages which
’ἕ e enjoys with all the rest. 1 owe a great debt to the
stan and to the moon; and yet they do not rise sor
*me alone. 1 am personally beholden to the seasons
