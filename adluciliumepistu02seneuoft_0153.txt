slippery ground3 because no one is beyond the
dangers of evil except him who has cleared himself
of it wholly. But no one has so cleared ‘himself
except the man who has adopted wisdom in its stead.

1 have often before explained the difference

between the diseases of the mind and its passions.
And 1 shall remind you once more: the diseases are
hardened and chronic vices, such as greed and
ambition3 they have enfolded the mind in too close
8 grip, and have begun to be permanent evils
thereof. To give a brief definition: by “disease”
we mean a persistent pei-version of the judgment, so
that things which are mildly desirable are thought
to be highly desirable. Or, if you prefer, we may
define it thus: to be too zealous in striving for things
which are only mildly desirable or not desirable at
all, or to value highly things which ought to be
valued but slightly or valued not at all. “ Passions ''
are objectionable impulses of the spirit, sudden and
vehement3 they have come so osten, and so little
attention has been paid to them, that they have
caused a state of disease3 just as a catarrh,‘² when
there has been but a single attack and the catarrh
has not yet become habitual, produces a cough, but
causes consumption when it has become regular and
chronic. Therefore we may say that those who
bave made most progr-ess are beyond the reach of
the “diseases''; but they still feel the “ passions ’'
ι even when very near perfection.

The second class is composed of those who have
'laid aside both the greatest ills of the mind and its
'passionffi but yet are not in assured possession of
iirnmunity.⁶ For they can still slip back into their
¹ former state. The third class are beyond the reach
