EPISTLES LXX.. LXXI.

Reason, too, advises us to die, if we may, according
to our taste3 if this cannot be, she advises us to die
according to our ability, and to seize upon whatever
means shall offer itself for doing violence to our·
selves. lt is crimina] to “live by robbery''“; but,
on the other hand, it is most noble to “die by
robbery.” Farewell.

LXXI. ΟΝ ΤΗΕ SUPREME GOOD

j You are continually referring special questions to
me, forgetting that a vast stretch of sea sunders us.
Since, however, the value of advice depends mostly
on the time when it is given, it must necessarily
result that by the time my opinion on certain matters
reaches you, the opposite opinion is the better. For
advice conforms to circumstances; and our circum-
»mances are carried along, or rather whirled along.
§Accordinglffi advice should be. produced at short
:notice3 and even this is too late3 it should “ grow
‚while we work,’' as the saying is. And I propose
ι ω show you how you may discover the method.

Aa osten as you wish to know what is to be
avoided or what is to be sought, consider its relation
¹ to the Supreme Good, to the purpose of your whole
life. For whatever we do ought to be in harmony
with this; no man can set in order the details unless
he has already set before himself the chief purpose
of his life. The artist may have his colours all

pared, but he cann t roduce a likeness unless
, e has alrzffliyffiffixw wishes to
paint) ame reason we make mistakes is be ause weall
*confidet the parts of life, but never life as a whole. ’
