EPISTLE LXXXVII.

Τὴε Peripatetics reply to this by saying that the
premiss is false3 that men do not in every case
become good by means of that which is good; that
in music there is something good, like a flute, a harp,
or an organ suited to accompany singing3 but that
Ἰ none of these instruments makes the musician. We
shall then reply: “ You do not understand in what
sense we have used the phrase ‘ that which is good in

gflutea and organs and harps; but they do not have
to do with the musician's art itself. For he is an
nrtist even without them3 he may perhaps be lack-

we notice that goods fall to the lot of the very lowest
nort of men, not only in the scholar’s art, but also in
the art of healing or in the art of navigating.” These
