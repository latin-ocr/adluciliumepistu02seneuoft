governed country, and good parents, are to be
reckoned as goods; but you cannot see these dear
objects in danger and be yourself at ease. Your
calm will be disturbed by a siege conducted against
your country, by the death of your children, or by
the enslaving of your parents.” 1 will first state
what we Stoics usually reply⁰ to these objectors,

perished, or children of approved goodness who fulfil
their father's prayers for them, there is something
that can fill their place. Do you ask what this is?
lt is that which had made them good in the first
place, namely, virtue. Virtue suffers no space in us
to be unoccupied3 it takes possession of the whole
toul and removes all sense of loss. It alone is
