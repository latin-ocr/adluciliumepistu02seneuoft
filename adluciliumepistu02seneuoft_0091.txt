’ ment? For what is free from the risk of change?
Neither earth, nor sky, nor the whole fabric of our
universe, though it be controlled by the hand of
God. It will not always preserve its present order3
it will be thrown from its course in days to come.“
All things move in accord with their appointed
times; they are destined to be born, to grow, and
to be destroyed. The stars which you see moving
above us, and this seemingly immovable earth to
which we cling and on which we are set, will be
consumed and will cease to exist. There is nothing
’ that does not have its old age3 the intervals are
¹ merely unequal at which Nature sends forth all these
things towards the same goal. Whatever is will
cease to be, and yet it will not perish, but will be

= controls all things, is working at this task.

Therefore the wise man will say just what a
Marcus Cato would say, aster reviewing his past life:
'⁸‘ The whole race of man, both that which is and
that which is to be, is condemned to die. Of all
,the cities that at any time have held sway over the
world, and of all that have been the splendid orna-
ments of empires not their own, men shall some day
ask where they were, and they shall be swept away
