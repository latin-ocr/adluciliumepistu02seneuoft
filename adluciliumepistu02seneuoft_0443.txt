EPISTLE XCI.

nit? When weapons are everywhere at rest, and
'when peace prevails throughout the world, Lyons,
¹the pride of Gaul‚‘² is missing!

Fortune has usually allowed all men, when she

11183 assailed them collectively, to have a foreboding
of that which they were destined to suffer. Every
great creation 1183 had granted to it a period of
reprieve before its fall ; but in this case, only a single
night elapsed between the city at its greatest and
the city non-existent. In short, it takes me longer
to tell you it has perished than it took for the city
to perish.
All this has affected our friend Liberalis, bending
his will, which is usually so steadfast and erect in
the face of 1113 own trials. And not without reason
has he been shaken; for it is the unexpected that
puts the heaviest load upon us. Strangeness adds
to the weight of calamities, and every mortal feels
the greater pain as a result of that which also brings
surprise.

Tberefore, nothing ought to be unexpected by us.
Our minds should be sent forward in advance to
meet 811 problems, and we should consider, not what
b wont to bappen, but what can happen. For what
13 there in' existence that F ortune, when she has so
wssled, does not drag down from the very height of
its prosperity? And what is there that she does
not the more violently assail the more brilliantly it
thineo? What is laborious or difficult for her Ρ She
does not always attack in one way, or even with her
full strength3 at one time she summons our own
hands against us; at another time, content with her
own powers, she makes use of no agent in devising
pen-ils sor 113. No time is exempt; in the midst of
our very pleasures there spring up 3811333 of suffering.
